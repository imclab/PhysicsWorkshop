Workshop materials created by David Wicks for residency at Miami University in 2013.

Processing sketches were used to introduce concepts of drawing with code and using
simulation in the creation of interactive drawings.

We drew shapes by hand, translated them to code, and applied physics to the shapes
on screen. Everyone ended up with something that jiggled, bounced, or collapsed in
one way or another.

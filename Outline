Introduction: What is Procesing

1. How to draw in code
Samples 1 and 2
Make a drawing, convert it into Processing
Label points A, B, C, D, etc

2. How to interact with code
Sample 3
mouse control
Make one (or all) of your drawing's points move with the mouse

3. Physics interactions: forces
Samples 4 â€” 5
Add physics to your existing drawing

4. Physics interaction: springs
Sample 6
keep your shape's integrity

5. Make a new physics shape
Draw on paper, label, convert to Processing as nodes and springs


next time:
remove conditionals from examples
easier way to add mouse grabbing?
for "advanced" sample, add texture mapping
make sure things work in processing.js

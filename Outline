How to draw in code
Samples 1 and 2
Make a drawing, convert it into Processing
Label points A, B, C, D, etc

How to interact with code
Sample 3
mouse control
Make one (or all) of your drawing's points move with the mouse

Physics interactions: forces
Samples 4 â€” 5
Add physics to your existing drawing

Physics interaction: springs
Sample 6
keep your shape's integrity

Finally: make your own physics shape
Draw on paper, label, convert to Processing as nodes and springs
